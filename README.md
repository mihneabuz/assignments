Projects and assignments from different courses I took.


Introduction to Programing | C

The start of the road for me :).
Looking back, most importantly from this course I learned about coding style and how to handle large projects. 
The code itself was simple, but I gained a lot of experience and confidence.


Data Structures | C

A continuation of Introduction to Programing.
Learned about different data structures, strengths and weaknesses, useful algorithms, how to implement in a low level language like C.
Also learned a lot about C (dynamic memory allocation, generic functions, good practice and coding style)


Numerical Methods | Octave

One of my favorite courses thus far. 
Made me really interested in mathematics and more advanced programing techniques like caching, vectorization and multi-threading. 
Also the foundation of my great interest in Machine Learning and AI :).
