Projects and assignments from different courses I took / am taking.

Tracking my progress and extracting deeper thoughts and lessons I learned along the way.


Introduction to Programing | C

The start of the road for me :).
Looking back, most importantly from this course I learned about coding style and how to handle large projects. 
The code itself was simple, but I gained a lot of experience and confidence.


Data Structures | C

A continuation of Introduction to Programing.
Learned about different data structures, strengths and weaknesses, useful algorithms, how to implement in a low level language like C.
Also learned a lot about C (dynamic memory allocation, generic functions, good practice and coding style)


Numerical Methods | Octave

One of my favorite courses thus far. 
Made me really interested in mathematics and more advanced performance optimization techniques like caching, vectorization and multi-threading. 
Also the foundation of my great interest in Machine Learning and AI :).


Introduction to Computer Structure and Assembly Language | C, x86 assembly

Getting closer to the silicon.
Learned about how computers actually work and the different layers of abstraction we have built on top of them. 
Made me really fascinated with compilers and how they make our work so much simpler and faster.
Also learned about exploitations.


Algorithm Analysis | Python

The theoretical part.
Learned about touring machines, decidability, complexities. Gave me new insight on how to approach problems in a more methodical way. 
Where before I had a tendency to throw things at the computer until it worked, I found now that sometimes a piece of paper and some deep thought can vastly accelerate the process.
Also I like to think that my code is generally faster now.


Object Oriented Programing | Java

A whole new world.
A great introduction to Java.
Learned about how to make a large codebase maintainable and how to make code as modular as possible as to make it possible to have large teams work together. 
Also learned about the security benefits of OO design.
This comes at a cost of performance(especially memory usage) and just large amount of code.
Interested in using this Java knowledge to break into Android maybe?


Machine Learning by Standford University | Octave

An amazing experience.
My first course I took on Coursera only to find out later that it is one of the best and oldest on the site.
With a focus on intuition and understanding the math behind it, I can say it's one of the best courses I took so far.
Learned how to design, implement, optimize and troubleshoot all kinds of different machine learning models.
I can't wait to begin Andrew Ng's other AI courses !
