Projects and assignments from different courses I took / am taking.


Introduction to Programing | C

The start of the road for me :).
Looking back, most importantly from this course I learned about coding style and how to handle large projects. 
The code itself was simple, but I gained a lot of experience and confidence.


Data Structures | C

A continuation of Introduction to Programing.
Learned about different data structures, strengths and weaknesses, useful algorithms, how to implement in a low level language like C.
Also learned a lot about C (dynamic memory allocation, generic functions, good practice and coding style)


Numerical Methods | Octave

One of my favorite courses thus far. 
Made me really interested in mathematics and more advanced performance optimization techniques like caching, vectorization and multi-threading. 
Also the foundation of my great interest in Machine Learning and AI :).


Introduction to Computer Structure and Assembly Language | C, x86 assembly

Getting closer to the silicon.
Learned about how computers actually work and the different layers of abstraction we have built on top of them. 
Made me really fascinated with compilers and how they make our work so much simpler and faster.
Also learned about exploitations.


Algorihtm Analysis | Python

The theoretical part.
Learned about touring machines, decidability, complexities. Gave me new insight on how to aproach problems in a more methodical way. 
Where before I had a tendancy to throw things at the computer until it worked, I found now that sometimes a piece of paper and some deep thought can vastly accelerate the process.
Also I like to think that my code is generally faster now.
